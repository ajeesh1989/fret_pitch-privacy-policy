At fret_pitch, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our guitar tuner application.

We do not record, store, or transmit any audio data. The audio signal is processed in real-time on your device.

We do not use this permission for any purpose other than detecting pitch for tuning.

Since we do not collect any personal or audio data, we do not share any information with third parties.

Both modes work completely offline and do not require any data collection.
